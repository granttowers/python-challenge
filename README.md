Fun Fact for the week - When were Arabic numerals invented?

They were developed in India by the Hindus around 600 A.D. Interestingly, these numbers were written "backwards", thus one hundred twenty three was written 321. Around 750 A.D. this system of decimal arithmetic was brought to Persia when several important Hindu works were translated into Arabic.

Interesting, nonetheless.
